This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript 3 collision detection. The `getBounds()` method can return incorrect results if the target DisplayObject isn't added to the display list or if the objects have different parent coordinate systems.  The `bug.as` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected version that uses localToGlobal() for accurate collision detection regardless of the objects' positions in the display list hierarchy.
